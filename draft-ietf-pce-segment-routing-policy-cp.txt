 Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for
              Segment Routing (SR) Policy Candidate Paths
              draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp-14

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet flow along any
   path.  SR Policy is an ordered list of segments (i.e., instructions)
   that represent a source-routed policy.  Packet flows are steered into
   an SR Policy on a node where it is instantiated called a headend
   node.  An SR Policy is made of one or more candidate paths.  This
   document specifies Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
   (PCEP) extension to associate candidate paths of the SR Policy.  It
   applies equally to the SR-MPLS and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6)
   instantiations of segment routing.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8664] specifies extensions that allow PCEP to work with basic SR-
   TE paths.  [RFC8697] introduces a generic mechanism to create a
   grouping of LSPs, called an Association.  [RFC9256] introduces the SR
   Policy construct as a grouping of SR Candidate Paths.

   This document extends [RFC8664] to support signaling SR Policy
   Candidate Paths and their attributes.  SR Policy is modeled in PCEP
   as an Association, where the SR Candidate Paths are the members of
   that Association.  Thus the PCE can take computation and control
   decisions about the Candidate Paths, with the additional knowledge
   that these Candidate Paths belong to the same SR Policy.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   Endpoint:  The IPv4 or IPv6 endpoint address of the SR Policy in
      question, as described in [RFC9256].

   SRPA:  SR Policy Association.  A new association type 'SR Policy
      Association' is used to group candidate paths belonging to the SR
      Policy.  Depending on discussion context, it can refer to the PCEP
      ASSOCIATION object of SR Policy type or to a group of LSPs that
      belong to the association.

   Association Parameters:  As described in [RFC8697], refers to the key
      data, that uniquely identifies the Association.

   Association Information:  As described in [RFC8697], refers to the
      non-key information about the Association.

3.  Overview

   The SR Policy is represented by a new type of PCEP Association,
   called the SR Policy Association (SRPA).  The SR Candidate Paths of
   an SR Policy are the PCEP LSPs within the same SRPA.  The subject of
   encoding multiple Segment Lists within an SR Policy Candidate Path is
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-multipath].

   The SRPA carries three pieces of information: SR Policy Identifier,
   SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier, and SR Policy Candidate Path
   Attribute(s).

   This document also specify some additional information that is not
   encoded as part of SRPA: Computation Priority, Explicit Null Label
   Policy, Drop upon Invalid behavior, and Specified-BSID-only.

3.1.  SR Policy Identifier

   SR Policy Identifier uniquely identifies the SR Policy [RFC9256]
   within the network.  SR Policy Identifier MUST be the same for all SR
   Policy Candidate Paths in the same SRPA.  SR Policy Identifier MUST
   NOT change for a given SR Policy Candidate Path during its lifetime.
   SR Policy Identifier MUST be different for different SRPAs.  When
   these rules are not satisfied, the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr
   message with Error-Type = 26 "Association Error", Error Value = TBD7
   "SR Policy Identifier Mismatch".  SR Policy Identifier consist of:

   *  Headend router where the SR Policy originates.

   *  Color of SR Policy.

   *  Endpoint of SR Policy.

3.2.  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier

   SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier uniquely identifies the SR Policy
   Candidate Path within the context of an SR Policy.  SR Policy
   Candidate Path Identifier MUST NOT change for a given LSP during its
   lifetime.  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifier MUST be different for
   distinct Candidate Paths within the same SRPA.  When these rules are
   not satisfied, the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   Type = 26 "Association Error", Error Value = TBD8 "SR Policy
   Candidate Path Identifier Mismatch".  SR Policy Candidate Path
   Identifier consist of:

   *  Protocol Origin.

   *  Originator.

Internet-Draft               PCEP SR Policy                   March 2024


   *  Discriminator.

3.3.  SR Policy Candidate Path Attributes

   SR Policy Candidate Path Attributes carry non-key information about
   the Candidate Path and MAY change during the lifetime of the LSP.  SR
   Policy Candidate Path Attributes consist of:

   *  Preference.

   *  Optionally, the SR Policy Candidate Path name.

   *  Optionally, the SR Policy name.

4.  SR Policy Association

   As per [RFC8697], LSPs are associated with other LSPs with which they
   interact by adding them to a common association group.  As described
   in [RFC8697], the association group is uniquely identified by the
   combination of the following fields in the ASSOCIATION object:
   Association Type, Association ID, Association Source, and (if
   present) Global Association Source or Extended Association ID,
   referred to as Association Parameters.

   [RFC8697] specify the ASSOCIATION Object with two Object-Types for
   IPv4 and IPv6 which includes the field "Association Type".  This
   document defines a new Association type (6) "SR Policy Association"
   for SRPA.

   This Association Type is dynamic in nature, thus operator-configured
   Association Range MUST NOT be set for this Association type and MUST
   be ignored.

   [RFC8697] specifies the mechanism for the capability advertisement of
   the Association Types supported by a PCEP speaker by defining an
   ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN object.  This
   capability exchange for the SR Policy Association Types MUST be done
   before using the SRPA.  Thus, the PCEP speaker MUST include the SRPA
   Type (6) in the ASSOC-Type-List TLV and MUST receive the same from
   the PCEP peer before using SRPA.

   A given LSP MUST belong to at most one SRPA, since an SR Policy
   Candidate Path cannot belong to multiple SR Policies.  If a PCEP
   speaker receives a PCEP message requesting to join more than one SRPA
   for the same LSP, then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message
   with Error-Type = 26 "Association Error", Error-Value = 7 "Cannot
   join the association group".

4.1.  Association Parameters

   As per [RFC9256], an SR Policy is identified through the tuple
   <headend, color, endpoint>.  The headend is encoded in the
   'Association Source' field in the ASSOCIATION object and the color
   and endpoint are encoded as part of the Extended Association ID TLV.

   The Association Parameters (see Section 2) consist of:

   *  Association Type: set to 6 "SR Policy Association".

   *  Association Source (IPv4/IPv6): set to the headend IP address.

   *  Association ID (16-bit): set to "1" (this 16-bit field is not
      utilized, just set to a fixed value).

   *  Extended Association ID TLV: encodes the Color and Endpoint of the
      SR Policy.

   The Association Source MUST be set to the headend value of the SR
   Policy, as defined in [RFC9256] Section 2.1.  If the PCC receives a
   PCInit message with the Association Source set not to the headend IP
   but to some globally unique IP address that the headend owns, then
   the PCC SHOULD accept the PCInit message and create the SRPA with the
   Association Source that was sent in the PCInit message.

   The 16-bit Association ID field in the ASSOCIATION object MUST be set
   to the value of "1".

   The Extended Association ID TLV MUST be included and it MUST be in
   the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

                Figure 1: Extended Association ID TLV format

   Type: Extended Association ID TLV, type = 31 [RFC8697].

   Length: Either 8 or 20, depending on whether IPv4 or IPv6 address is
   encoded in the Endpoint field.

Internet-Draft               PCEP SR Policy                   March 2024


   Color: SR Policy color value, non-zero as per [RFC9256] Section 2.1.

   Endpoint: can be either IPv4 or IPv6.  This value MAY be different
   from the one contained in the Destination address field in the END-
   POINTS object, or in the Tunnel Endpoint Address field in the LSP-
   IDENTIFIERS TLV.

   If the PCEP speaker receives an SRPA object whose Association
   Parameters do not follow the above specification, then the PCEP
   speaker MUST send PCErr message with Error-Type = 26 "Association
   Error", Error-Value = TBD7 "SR Policy Identifier Mismatch".

   The purpose of choosing the Association Parameters in this way is to
   guarantee that there is no possibility of a race condition when
   multiple PCEP speakers want to associate the same SR Policy at the
   same time.  By adhering to this format, all PCEP speakers come up
   with the same Association Parameters independently of each other
   based on the SR Policy [RFC9256] parameters.  Thus, there is no
   chance that different PCEP speakers will come up with different
   Association Parameters for the same SR Policy.

   The last hop of the computed SR Policy Candidate Path MAY differ from
   the Endpoint contained in the <headend, color, endpoint> tuple.  An
   example use case is to terminate the SR Policy before reaching the
   Endpoint and have decapsulated traffic go the rest of the way to the
   Endpoint node using the native IGP path(s).  In this example, the
   destination of the SR Policy Candidate Paths will be some node before
   the Endpoint, but the Endpoint value is still used at the head-end to
   steer traffic with that Endpoint IP into the SR Policy.  Destination
   of the SR Policy Candidate Path is signaled using the END-POINTS
   object and/or LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV, as per the usual PCEP procedures.
   When neither END-POINTS object nor LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV is present,
   the PCEP speaker MUST extract the destination from the Endpoint field
   in the SRPA Extended Association ID TLV.

4.2.  Association Information

   The SRPA object may carry the following TLVs:

   *  SRPOLICY-POL-NAME TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy Name string.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID TLV: (mandatory) encodes SR Policy Candidate
      Path Identifier.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-NAME TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy Candidate
      Path string name.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-PREFERENCE TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy
      Candidate Path preference value.

   Out of these TLVs, the SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID TLV is mandatory, all others
   are optional.  When a mandatory TLV is missing from the SRPA object,
   the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 6
   "Mandatory Object Missing", Error-Value = TBD6 "Missing SR Policy
   Mandatory TLV".

   This document specifies four new TLVs to be carried in the SRPA
   object.  Only one TLV instance of each type can be carried, and only
   the first occurrence is processed.  Any others MUST be ignored.

4.2.1.  SR Policy Name TLV

   The SRPOLICY-POL-NAME TLV is an optional TLV for the SRPA object.

   Protocol Origin: 8-bit value that encodes the protocol origin, as
   specified in Section 6.5.  Note that in PCInitiate message [RFC8281],
   the Protocol Origin is always set to 10 (PCEP).

   MBZ: Must be zero.

   Originator ASN: Represented as 4-byte number, part of the originator
   identifier, as specified in [RFC9256] Section 2.4.  If 2-byte ASNs
   are in use, the low-order 16 bits is used, and the high-order bits
   are set to 0.  When sending PCInitiate message [RFC8281], the PCE is
   acting as the originator and therefore SHOULD set this to an ASN that
   it belongs to.

   Originator Address: Represented as 128-bit value where IPv4 address
   is encoded in lowest 32 bits and high-order bits are set to 0, part
   of the originator identifier, as specified in [RFC9256] Section 2.4.
   When sending PCInitiate message, the PCE is acting as the originator
   and therefore SHOULD set this to an address that it owns.

   Discriminator: 32-bit value that encodes the Discriminator of the
   Candidate Path, as specified in [RFC9256] Section 2.5.  This is the
   field that mainly distinguishes different SR Candidate Paths, coming
   from the same originator.  It is allowed to be any number in the
   32-bit range.

5.  Other Mechanisms

   This section describes mechanisms that are standardized for SR
   Policies in [RFC9256], but do not make use of the SRPA for signaling
   in PCEP.  Since SRPA is not used, there needs to be a separate
   capability negotiation.

   This document specifies four new TLVs to be carried in the OPEN or
   LSP object.  Only one TLV instance of each type can be carried, and
   only the first occurrence is processed.  Any others MUST be ignored.

5.1.  SR Policy Capability TLV

   The SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV is an optional TLV for the OPEN object.
   It is used at session establishment time to learn the other PCEP
   peer's capabilities with respect to SR Policy.

   Policy, see Section 5.5.

   L-Flag: PCEP speaker supports stateless (PCReq/PCRep) operations with
   SR Policy, see Section 5.6.

   Unassigned bits MUST be set to '0' on transmission and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.

5.2.  Computation Priority TLV

   The COMPUTATION-PRIORITY TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.
   It is used to signal the numerical computation priority, as specified
   in Section 2.12 of [RFC9256].  If the TLV is absent from the LSP
   object, a default Priority value of 128 is used.

5.3.  Explicit Null Label Policy (ENLP) TLV

   To steer an unlabeled IP packet into an SR policy, it is necessary to
   create a label stack for that packet, and push one or more labels
   onto that stack.  The Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP) TLV is an
   optional TLV used to indicate whether an Explicit NULL Label
   [RFC3032] must be pushed on an unlabeled IP packet before any other
   labels.  The contents of this TLV are used by the SRPM as described
   in section 4.1 of [RFC9256].  If an ENLP TLV is not present, the
   decision of whether to push an Explicit NULL label on a given packet
   is a matter of local configuration.

   Type: TBD2 for "ENLP" TLV.

   Length: 4.

   ENLP (Explicit NULL Label Policy): Indicates whether Explicit NULL
   labels are to be pushed on unlabeled IP packets that are being
   steered into a given SR policy.  This field has one of the following
   values:

   *  0: Reserved.

   *  1: Push an IPv4 Explicit NULL label on an unlabeled IPv4 packet,
      but do not push an IPv6 Explicit NULL label on an unlabeled IPv6
      packet.

   *  2: Push an IPv6 Explicit NULL label on an unlabeled IPv6 packet,
      but do not push an IPv4 Explicit NULL label on an unlabeled IPv4
      packet.

   *  3: Push an IPv4 Explicit NULL label on an unlabeled IPv4 packet,
      and push an IPv6 Explicit NULL label on an unlabeled IPv6 packet.

   *  4: Do not push an Explicit NULL label.

   *  5 - 255: Reserved.

   The ENLP reserved values may be used for future extensions and
   implementations SHOULD ignore the ENLP TLV with these values.  The
   behavior signaled in this TLV MAY be overridden by local
   configuration.  The section 4.1 of [RFC9256] describes the behavior
   on the headend for the handling of the explicit null label.

5.4.  Invalidation TLV

   The INVALIDATION TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.  It is
   used to control traffic steering into the LSP during the time when
   the LSP is operationally down/invalid.  In the context of SR Policy,
   this TLV facilitates the "Drop upon invalid" behavior, specified in
   Section 8.2 of [RFC9256].  Normally, if the LSP is down/invalid then
   it stops attracting traffic and traffic that is originally destined
   for that LSP is redirected somewhere else, such as via IGP or via
   another LSP.  The "Drop upon invalid" behavior specifies that the LSP
   keeps attracting traffic and the traffic has to be dropped at the
   head-end.  Such an LSP is said to be "in drop state".  While in the
   drop state, the LSP operational state is "UP", as indicated by the
   O-flag in the LSP object.  However the ERO object MAY be empty, if no
   valid path has been computed.

   The INVALIDATION TLV is used in both directions between PCEP peers:

   *  PCE -> PCC: PCE specifies to the PCC under what conditions the LSP
      should enter the drop state.

   *  PCC -> PCE: PCC reports under what conditions the LSP will enter
      the drop state and the PCC also reports whether the LSP is
      currently in the drop state and if so, for what reason.

   Reasons for entering the drop state are represented by a set of
   flags.

   *  V: Verification failure - OAM/PM/BFD path verification has
      indicated a breakage.

   *  The unassigned bits in the Flag octet MUST be set to zero upon
      transmission and MUST be ignored upon receipt.

   Inval Reason: contains "Invalidation Reasons Flags" which encode the
   reason(s) why the LSP is currently invalidated.  This field can be
   set to non-zero values only by the PCC, it MUST be set to 0 by the
   PCE and ignored by the PCC.

   Drop Upon: contains "Invalidation Reasons Flags" for conditions that
   SHOULD cause the LSP to enter drop state.  This field can be set to
   non-zero values by both PCC and PCE.  When the G-flag is set, this
   indicates that the LSP is to go into Drop upon invalid state for any
   reason.  I.e., when the PCE does not wish to distinguish any reason
   for LSP invalidation and just simply wants it to always go into drop
   state whenever the LSP is down.  Note that when the G-flag is set,
   the values of the other flags are irrelevant.

   Note that out of all the "Invalidation Reasons Flags", only the
   G-flag (Generic) MUST be supported.  The other flags can simply be
   ignored if they are not supported by the PCEP speaker.  For example,
   suppose the PCC only supports P-flag and G-flag.  When this PCC
   receives this TLV with Drop Upon set to 0x6 (P,F), then the PCC
   responds with Drop Upon = 0x4 (P).  When this PCC receives this TLV
   with Drop Upon set to 0x7 (P,F,G), then the PCC responds with Drop
   Upon = 0x5 (P,G).

5.5.  Specified-BSID-only

   Specified-BSID-only functionality is defined in Section 6.2.3 of
   [RFC9256].  When specified-BSID-only is enabled for a particular
   binding SID, it means that the given binding SID is required to be
   allocated and programmed for the LSP to be operationally up.  If the
   binding SID cannot be allocated or programmed for some reason, then
   the LSP must stay down.

   To signal specified-BSID-only, a new bit: S (Specified-BSID-only) is
   allocated in the "TE-PATH-BINDING TLV Flag field" of the TE-PATH-
   BINDING TLV [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid].  When this bit is set
   for a particular BSID, it means that the BSID follows the Specified-
   BSID-only behavior.  It is possible to have a mix of BSIDs for the
   same LSP: some with S=1 and some with S=0.

5.6.  Stateless Operation

   [RFC8231] Section 5.8.2, allows delegation of an LSP in operationally
   down state, but at the same time mandates the use of PCReq before
   sending PCRpt.  This document modifies the procedure of [RFC8231]
   Section 5.8.2, for SR Policies we make sending of PCReq before PCRpt
   OPTIONAL.  Thus, when a PCC wants to delegate an SR Policy LSP, it
   MAY proceed directly to sending PCRpt, without first sending PCReq
   and waiting for PCRep.  This has the advantage of reducing the number

   of PCEP messages and simplifying the implementation.

   Furthermore, a PCEP speaker is not required to support PCReq/PCRep at
   all for SR Policies.  The PCEP speaker can indicate support for
   PCReq/PCRep via the "L-Flag" in the SRPOLICY-CAPABILITY TLV (See
   Section 5.1).  When this flag is cleared, or when the SRPOLICY-
   CAPABILITY TLV is absent, the given peer SHOULD NOT be sent PCReq/
   PCRep messages for SR Policy LSPs.  Conversely when this flag is set,
   the peer can receive and process PCReq/PCRep messages for SR Policy
   LSPs.

   The above applies only to SR Policy LSPs and does not affect other
   LSP types, such as RSVP-TE LSPs.  For other LSP types, [RFC8231]
   Section 5.8.2 continues to apply.

6.  IANA Considerations

7.  Implementation Status

   [Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
   well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]

Internet-Draft               PCEP SR Policy                   March 2024


   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

8.  Security Considerations

   This document defines one new type for ASSOCIATION object, which does
   not add any new security concerns beyond those discussed in
   [RFC5440], [RFC8231], [RFC8664] and [RFC8697] in itself.

   The information carried in the SRPA object, as per this document is
   related to SR Policy.  It often reflects information that can also be
   derived from the SR Database, but association provides a much easier
   grouping of related LSPs and messages.  The SRPA could provide an
   adversary with the opportunity to eavesdrop on the relationship
   between the LSPs.  Thus securing the PCEP session using Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the recommendations and best
   current practices in [RFC7525], is RECOMMENDED.

9.  Acknowledgement

   Would like to thank Stephane Litkowski, Boris Khasanov, Abdul Rehman,
   Alex Tokar, Praveen Kumar and Tom Petch for review and suggestions.
