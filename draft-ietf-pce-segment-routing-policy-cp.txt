    PCEP extension to support Segment Routing Policy Candidate Paths
              draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp-12

Abstract

   A Segment Routing (SR) Policy [RFC9256] is a non-empty set of SR
   Candidate Paths, that share the same <headend, color, endpoint>
   tuple.  This document extends [RFC8664] to fully support the SR
   Policy construct.  SR Policy is modeled in PCEP as an Association of
   one or more SR Candidate Paths.  PCEP extensions are defined to
   signal additional attributes of an SR Policy, which are not covered
   by [RFC8664].  The mechanism is applicable to all data planes of SR
   (MPLS, SRv6, etc.).

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

1.  Introduction

   PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing [RFC8664] specifies extensions
   that allow PCEP to work with basic SR-TE paths.

   PCEP Extensions for Establishing Relationships Between Sets of LSPs
   [RFC8697] introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
   LSPs, called an Association.

   Segment Routing Policy for Traffic Engineering [RFC9256] introduces
   the SR Policy construct as a grouping of SR Candidate Paths.

   This document extends [RFC8664] to fully support the SR Policy
   construct.  SR Policy is modeled in PCEP as an Association and the SR
   Candidate Paths are the members of that Association.  Thus the PCE
   can take computation and control decisions about the Candidate Paths,
   with the additional knowledge that these Candidate Paths belong to
   the same SR Policy.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   Endpoint:  The IPv4 or IPv6 endpoint address of the SR Policy in
      question, as described in [RFC9256].

   SRPA:  SR Policy Association.  PCEP ASSOCATION that describes the SR
      Policy.  Depending on discussion context, it refers to a PCEP
      object or to a group of LSPs that belong to the Association.

   Association Parameters:  As described in [RFC8697], refers to the key
      data, that uniquely identifies the Association in the network.

   Association Information:  As described in [RFC8697], refers to the
      non-key information about the Association.

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association              July 2023


3.  Overview

   The SR Policy is represented by a new type of PCEP Association,
   called the SR Policy Association (SRPA).  The SR Candidate Paths of
   an SR Policy are the PCEP LSPs within the same SRPA.  The subject of
   encoding multiple Segment Lists within an SR Policy Candidate Path is
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-multipath].

   The SRPA carries three pieces of information: SR Policy Identifiers,
   SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers, and SR Policy Candidate Path
   Attributes.

   Additional information is also carried outside of SRPA: Computation
   Priority, Explicit Null Label Policy, Drop upon Invalid behavior, and
   Specified-BSID-only.

3.1.  SR Policy Identifiers

   SR Policy Identifiers uniquely identify the SR Policy within the
   network.  SR Policy Identifiers MUST be the same for all SR Policy
   Candidate Paths in the same SRPA.  SR Policy Identifiers MUST NOT
   change for a given SR Policy Candidate Path during its lifetime.  SR
   Policy Identifiers MUST be different for different SRPAs.  SR Policy
   Identifiers consist of:

   *  Headend router where the SR Policy originates.

   *  Color of SR Policy.

   *  Endpoint of SR Policy.

3.2.  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers

   SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers uniquely identify the SR Policy
   Candidate Path within the context of an SR Policy.  SR Policy
   Candidate Path Identifiers MUST NOT change for a given LSP during its
   lifetime.  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers MUST be different for
   different Candidate Paths within the same SRPA.  When these rules are
   not satisfied, the PCE MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 26
   "Association Error", Error Value = TBD8 "SR Policy Candidate Path
   Identifiers Mismatch".  SR Policy Candidate Path Identifiers consist
   of:

   *  Protocol Origin.

   *  Originator.

   *  Discriminator.

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association              July 2023


3.3.  SR Policy Candidate Path Attributes

   SR Policy Candidate Path Attributes carry non-key information about
   the Candidate Path and MAY change during the lifetime of the LSP.  SR
   Policy Candidate Path Attributes consist of:

   *  Preference.

   *  Optionally, the SR Policy Candidate Path name.

   *  Optionally, the SR Policy name.

4.  SR Policy Association

   Two ASSOCIATION object types for IPv4 and IPv6 are defined in
   [RFC8697].  The ASSOCIATION object includes "Association Type"
   indicating the type of the association group.  This document adds a
   new Association Type (6) "SR Policy Association".

   This Association Type is dynamic in nature, thus operator-configured
   Association Range MUST NOT be set for this Association type and MUST
   be ignored.

   A PCEP speaker that supports the SRPA MUST send the ASSOC-Type-List
   TLV, defined in [RFC8697] Section 4.1, containing the value (6),
   corresponding to the SRPA Association Type.  Otherwise the PCEP
   speaker MUST assume that the remote PCEP peer does not support SRPA
   and MUST NOT send the SRPA to that remote peer.

   A given LSP MUST belong to at most one SRPA, since an SR Policy
   Candidate Path cannot belong to multiple SR Policies.  If a PCEP
   speaker receives a PCEP message requesting to join more than one SRPA
   for the same LSP, then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message
   with Error-Type = 26 "Association Error", Error-Value = 7 "Cannot
   join the association group".

4.1.  Association Parameters

   As per [RFC9256], an SR Policy is identified through the tuple
   <headend, color, endpoint>.  The headend is encoded as the
   Association Source in the ASSOCIATION object and the color and
   endpoint are encoded as part of Extended Association ID TLV.

   The Association Parameters (see Section 2) consist of:

   *  Association Type: set to 6 "SR Policy Association".

   *  Association Source (IPv4/IPv6): set to the headend IP address.

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association              July 2023


   *  Association ID (16-bit): set to "1".

   *  Extended Association ID TLV: encodes the Color and Endpoint of the
      SR Policy.

   The Association Source MUST be set to the headend value of the SR
   Policy, as defined in [RFC9256] Section 2.1.  If the PCC receives a
   PCInit message with the Association Source set not to the headend IP
   but to some globally unique IP address that the headend owns, then
   the PCC SHOULD accept the PCInit message and create the SR Policy
   Association with the Association Source that was sent in the PCInit
   message.

   The 16-bit Association ID field in the ASSOCIATION object MUST be set
   to the value of "1".

   The Extended Association ID TLV MUST be included and it MUST be in
   the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      |           Type = 31           |       Length = 8 or 20        |

      ~                           Endpoint                            ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                Figure 1: Extended Association ID TLV format

   Type: Extended Association ID TLV, type = 31.

   Length: Either 8 or 20, depending on whether IPv4 or IPv6 address is
   encoded in the Endpoint.

   Color: SR Policy color value, non-zero as per [RFC9256] Section 2.1.

   Endpoint: can be either IPv4 or IPv6.  This value MAY be different
   from the one contained in the END-POINTS object, or in the LSP-
   IDENTIFIERS TLV.

   If the PCEP speaker receives an SRPA object whose Association
   Parameters do not follow the above specification, then the PCEP
   speaker MUST send PCErr message with Error-Type = 26 "Association
   Error", Error-Value = TBD7 "SR Policy Identifiers Mismatch".

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association              July 2023


   The purpose of choosing the Association Parameters in this way is to
   guarantee that there is no possibility of a race condition when
   multiple PCEP speakers want to create the same SR Policy at the same
   time.  By adhering to this format, all PCEP speakers come up with the
   same Association Parameters independently of each other.  Thus, there
   is no chance that different PCEP speakers will come up with different
   Association Parameters for the same SR Policy.

   The computed destination of the SR Policy Candidate Path MAY differ
   from the Endpoint contained in the <headend, color, endpoint> tuple.
   An example use case is to terminate the SR Policy before reaching the
   Endpoint and have decapsulated traffic go the rest of the way to the
   Endpoint node using the native IGP path(s).  In this example, the
   destination of the SR Policy Candidate Paths will be some node before
   the Endpoint, but the Endpoint value is still used at the head-end to
   steer traffic with that Endpoint IP into the SR Policy.  Destination
   of the SR Policy Candidate Path is signaled using the END-POINTS
   object and/or LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV, as per the usual PCEP procedures.
   When neither END-POINTS object nor LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV is present,
   the PCEP speaker MUST extract the destination from the Endpoint field
   in the SRPA Extended Association ID TLV.

4.2.  Association Information

   The SRPA object contains the following TLVs:

   *  SRPOLICY-POL-NAME TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy Name string.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID TLV: (mandatory) encodes SR Policy Candidate
      Path Identifiers.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-NAME TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy Candidate
      Path string name.

   *  SRPOLICY-CPATH-PREFERENCE TLV: (optional) encodes SR Policy
      Candidate Path preference value.

   Of these new TLVs, SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID TLV is mandatory.  When a
   mandatory TLV is missing from the SRPA object, the PCE MUST send a
   PCErr message with Error-Type = 6 "Mandatory Object Missing", Error-
   Value = TBD6 "Missing Mandatory TLV".

   Unless specifically stated otherwise, the TLVs listed in the
   following sub-sections are assumed to be single instance.  Meaning,
   only one instance of the TLV SHOULD be present in the object and only
   the first instance of the TLV SHOULD be interpreted and subsequent
   instances SHOULD be ignored.

   Type: 57 for "SRPOLICY-CPATH-ID" TLV.

   Length: 28.

   Protocol Origin: 8-bit value that encodes the protocol origin, as
   specified in [RFC9256] Section 2.3.  Note that in PCInit messages,
   the Protocol Origin is always set to "PCEP".

   Originator ASN: Represented as 4 byte number, part of the originator
   identifier, as specified in [RFC9256] Section 2.4.  When sending
   PCInit, the PCE is acting as the originator and therefore SHOULD set
   this to an ASN that it belongs to.

   Originator Address: Represented as 128 bit value where IPv4 address
   are encoded in lowest 32 bits, part of the originator identifier, as
   specified in [RFC9256] Section 2.4.  When sending PCInit, the PCE is
   acting as the originator and therefore SHOULD set this to an address
   that it owns.

   Discriminator: 32-bit value that encodes the Discriminator of the
   Candidate Path.  This is the field that mainly distinguishes
   different SR Candidate Paths, coming from the same originator.  It is
   allowed to be any number in the 32-bit range.

5.  Other Mechanisms

   This section describes mechanisms that are standardized for SR
   Policies in [RFC9256], but do not make use of the SRPA for signaling
   in PCEP.  Since SRPA is not used, there needs to be a separate
   capability negotiation.

5.1.  SR Policy Capability TLV

   The SR-POLICY-CAPABILITY TLV is an optional TLV for the OPEN object.
   It is used at session establishment time to learn the other PCEP
   peer's capabilities with respect to SR Policy.

5.2.  Computation Priority TLV

   The COMPUTATION-PRIORITY TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.
   It is used to signal the numerical computation priority, as specified
   in Section 2.12 of [RFC9256].  If the TLV is absent from the LSP
   object, a default Priority value of 128 is used.

   [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].

5.4.  Invalidation TLV

   The INVALIDATION TLV is an optional TLV for the LSP object.  It is
   used to control traffic streering into the LSP during the time when
   the LSP is operationally down/invalid.  In the context of SR Policy,
   this TLV facilitates the "Drop upon invalid" behavior, specified in
   Section 8.2 of [RFC9256].  Normally, if the LSP is down/invalid then
   it stops attracting traffic and traffic that is originally destined
   for that LSP is redirected somewhere else, such as via IGP or via
   another LSP.  The "Drop upon invalid" behavior specifies that the LSP
   keeps attracting traffic and the traffic has to be dropped at the
   head-end.  Such an LSP is said to be "in drop state".  While in the
   drop state, the LSP operational state is "UP", as indicated by the
   O-flag in the LSP object.  However the ERO object MAY be empty, if no
   valid path has been computed.

   The INVALIDATION TLV is used in both directions between PCEP peers:

   *  PCE -> PCC: PCE specifies to the PCC under what conditions the LSP
      should enter the drop state.

   *  PCC -> PCE: PCC reports under what conditions the LSP will enter
      the drop state and the PCC also reports whether the LSP is
      currently in the drop state and if so, for what reason.

   Reasons for entering the drop state are represented by a set of
   flags.

                   Figure 10: The INVALIDATION TLV format

   Type: TBD3 for "INVALIDATION" TLV.

   Length: 4.

   Inval Reason: contains "Invalidation Reasons Flags" which encode the
   reason(s) why the LSP is currently invalidated.  This field can be
   set to non-zero values only by the PCC, it MUST be set to 0 by the
   PCE and ignored by the PCC.

   Drop Upon: contains "Invalidation Reasons Flags" for conditions that
   SHOULD cause the LSP to enter drop state.  This field can be set to
   non-zero values by both PCC and PCE.  When the G-flag is set, this
   indicates that the LSP is to go into Drop upon invalid state for any
   reason.  I.e., when the PCE does not wish to distinguish any reason
   for LSP invalidation and just simply wants it to always go into drop
   state whenever the LSP is down.  Note that when the G-flag is set,
   the values of the other flags are irrelevant.

   Note that out of all the "Invalidation Reasons Flags", only the
   G-flag (Generic) MUST be supported.  The other flags can simply be
   ignored if they are not supported by the PCEP speaker.  For example,



Koldychev, et al.        Expires 23 January 2024               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft         PCEP SR Policy Association              July 2023


   suppose the PCC only supports P-flag and G-flag.  When this PCC
   receives this TLV with Drop Upon set to 0x6 (P,F), then the PCC
   responds with Drop Upon = 0x4 (P).  When this PCC receives this TLV
   with Drop Upon set to 0x7 (P,F,G), then the PCC responds with Drop
   Upon = 0x5 (P,G).

5.5.  Specified-BSID-only

   Specified-BSID-only functionality is defined in Section 6.2.3 of
   [RFC9256].  When specified-BSID-only is enabled for a particular
   binding SID, it means that the given binding SID is required to be
   allocated and programmed for the LSP to be operationally up.  If the
   binding SID cannot be allocated or programmed for some reason, then
   the LSP must stay down.

   To signal specified-BSID-only, a new bit: S (Specified-BSID-only) is
   allocated in the "TE-PATH-BINDING TLV Flag field" of the TE-PATH-
   BINDING TLV.  When this bit is set for a particular BSID, it means
   that the BSID follows the Specified-BSID-only behavior.  It is
   possible to have a mix of BSIDs for the same LSP: some with S=1 and
   some with S=0.

5.6.  Stateless Operation

   [RFC8231] Section 5.8.2, allows delegation of an LSP in operationally
   down state, but at the same time mandates the use of PCReq before
   sending PCRpt.  This document modifies the procedure of [RFC8231]
   Section 5.8.2, for SR Policies we make sending of PCReq before PCRpt
   OPTIONAL.  Thus, when a PCC wants to delegate an SR Policy LSP, it
   MAY proceed directly to sending PCRpt, without first sending PCReq
   and waiting for PCRep.  This has the advantage of reducing the number
   of PCEP messages and simplifying the implementation.

   Furthermore, a PCEP speaker is not required to support PCReq/PCRep at
   all for SR Policies.  The PCEP speaker can indicate support for
   PCReq/PCRep via the "L-Flag" in the SR-POLICY-CAPABILITY TLV (See
   Section 5.1).  When this flag is cleared, or when the SR-POLICY-
   CAPABILITY TLV is absent, the given peer SHOULD NOT be sent PCReq/
   PCRep messages for SR Policy LSPs.  Conversely when this flag is set,
   the peer can receive and process PCReq/PCRep messages for SR Policy
   LSPs.

   The above applies only to SR Policy LSPs and does not affect other
   LSP types, such as RSVP-TE LSPs.  For other LSP types, [RFC8231]
   Section 5.8.2 continues to apply.

7.  Implementation Status

   [Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
   well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

8.  Security Considerations

   This document defines one new type for association, which do not add
   any new security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], [RFC8664], [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] and
   [RFC8697] in itself.

   The information carried in the SRPA object, as per this document is
   related to SR Policy.  It often reflects information that can also be
   derived from the SR Database, but association provides a much easier
   grouping of related LSPs and messages.  The SRPA could provide an
   adversary with the opportunity to eavesdrop on the relationship
   between the LSPs.  Thus securing the PCEP session using Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the recommendations and best
   current practices in [RFC7525], is RECOMMENDED.
